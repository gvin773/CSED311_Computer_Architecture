# CSED311_Computer_Architecture
Computer architecture is the science and art of selecting and interconnecting hardware components to create a computer that meets functional, performance, and cost goals.
This course introduces the basic principles and hardware structures of a modern general-purpose computer.
We will learn, for example, how to design the control and datapath for a pipelined RISC processor and how to design fast memory and storage systems.
The principles presented in the lectures are reinforced in the laboratory through designing and implementing a RISC processor in Register Transfer-Level (RTL) using Verilog HDL.

## Assignments
### Lab 1 RTL design
 - Implement ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) in Verilog
 - Implement a simple vending machine RTL in Verilog: A simple Finite State Machine (FSM)

### Lab 2 Single-cycle CPU
 - Implement a single-cycle RISC-V CPU (RV32I)

### Lab 3 Multi-Cycle CPU
 - Implement a multi-cycle RISC-V CPU (RV32I)

### Lab 4-1 - pipelined CPU without control flow instructions
 - 5-stage pipelined CPU (w/o control flow instrs.)

### Lab 4-2 - pipelined CPU or ~~branch predictor~~
  - 5-stage pipelined CPU w/ control flow instructions

### Lab 5 - cache or ~~data prefetcher~~
  - Implement blocking data cache upon your Lab4-2a implementation
