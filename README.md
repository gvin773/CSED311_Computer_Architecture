# CSED311_Computer_Architecture
Computer architecture is the science and art of selecting and interconnecting hardware components to create a computer that meets functional, performance, and cost goals.
This course introduces the basic principles and hardware structures of a modern general-purpose computer.
We will learn, for example, how to design the control and datapath for a pipelined RISC processor and how to design fast memory and storage systems.
The principles presented in the lectures are reinforced in the laboratory through designing and implementing a RISC processor in Register Transfer-Level (RTL) using Verilog HDL.
